# Tic Tac Toe game using Python

- User will be presented with the layout
- Users are X and O (upper case O)
- Game prints when a player wins or if it ends in a tie

## Assumption

- Player will always enter a valid spot to make the next move (in this case from 0 till 8)
- If user enters a negative or invalid number greater than 8 then the program cannot handle this situation.

## Improvement in this version

- User will not be able to overwrite an already played spot. User will be prompted to try again before game moves to the next player

## Wanted Improvement

- If user enters a number outside of the range 0, 8 then a message should be shown and user should be prompted to try again
